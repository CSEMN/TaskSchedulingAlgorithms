# TaskSchedulingAlgorithms
Python Implementation for Task Scheduling Algorithms ( FCFS, RR, EDF, LST, RMA, DMA ) as well as accumulative utility test and Completion-time test using Tkinter for GUI   

## Get Started
 run ```python main.py``` to start the GUI

### Supported Algorithms
1. FCFS : First come First Serve
2. RR   : Round Robin
3. EDF  : Earliest deadline First
4. LST  : Least slack time
5. RMA  : Rate Monotonic assignment
6. DMA  : Deadline Monotonic assignment
